🤖 PRAGYAN-NEXUS-AI
A Futuristic School Intelligence System
📌 Project Overview

PRAGYAN-NEXUS-AI is a school-specific artificial intelligence chatbot developed as a Class 12 Artificial Intelligence practical project.
The system is designed to act as a central digital intelligence hub for Pragyan Public School, providing accurate, structured, and verified information to students, parents, and visitors.

Unlike general AI chatbots, this project follows a rule-based institutional AI approach, ensuring reliability, clarity, and controlled responses strictly limited to school-related information.

🎯 Objectives

To demonstrate practical application of Artificial Intelligence concepts

To build a school-locked intelligent chatbot

To provide quick access to verified school information

To simulate intelligent behavior using rule-based decision logic

To design a stable and explainable AI system suitable for academic evaluation

🧠 Key Features
